"""
Simulates physical memory.
Our model is segmented, with paging, so the smallest op size is 1 frame.
Memory is stored as a list, and each element is one frame. Data is represented
as an integer, making it possible to simulate the effects of trampling memory
due to student error, as well as allowing for more interesting visualization.

PhysicalMemory uses the following methods from algorithms.py:
    - allocate_page
    - free_page
